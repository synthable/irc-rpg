A sloppy implementation of a game based on IRC user's scores.

A users would vote on something funny or stupid another user said and if a vote threshold was exceeded then they would either gain or lose a point.

I must have been really bored when I started this and the code isn't even that good.  Kept here for historical reasons...or maybe I'll clean it up and make it worth something.
